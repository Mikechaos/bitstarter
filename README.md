# Coursera class - Startup Engineering
## Final Project

### Quick history
I am actually taking a marvelous class on Coursera. The instructor(s) guide you through every step of getting the foundation up and running for you own startup.
The final project is to build a simple selfstarter based on bitcoins and market your own idea/product on it.

### What is on now
Only the basic html structure of the home page.

### Requirement 
* Node
* Express  
    `$npm install express`

### What to expect
I am not sure how this project will evolve. We'll see as we go..!

Have fun
