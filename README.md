# Coursera class - Startup Engineering
## Final Project

### Quick history
I am actually taking a marvelous class on Coursera. The instructor(s) guide you through every step of getting the foundation up and running for you own startup.
The final project is to build a simple selfstarter based on bitcoins and market your own idea/product on it.

### What is on now
Only the basic html structure of the home page.

### Requirement 
* Node
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/ "Express Doc") $`npm install express`  
* For grader (HW3)
    * [Restler](https://github.com/danwrong/restler, "Restler on Github") $`npm install restler`
    * [Cheerio](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/cheerio, "Cheerio on Github") $`npm install cheerio`


### What to expect
I am not sure how this project will evolve. I have many ideas. What you will probably see in the future
- Some Clojure on the server side might be coming.  
  Want to check if clojure and node can work together
- CoffeeScript in place of Javascript
- An actual project. Ideas..
    - ... not yet!

We'll see as we go..!

Have fun
